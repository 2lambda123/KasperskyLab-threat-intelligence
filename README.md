# Threat Intelligence

The project aims to distribute a comprehensive suite of tools for the integration and convenient use of Kaspersky Threat Intelligence services. Open-source connectors alleviate the burden on support teams and empowers customers to resolve issues independently, creating a more positive customer experience. By embracing open-source principles, we can demonstrate commitment to transparency, collaboration, and innovation. This positive brand perception fosters trust among potential customers and strengthens our competitive edge in the market.

The current version includes only a connector for Kaspersky Threat Data Feeds to the OpenCTI platform which would enable seamless integration of our commercial data feeds into existing security infrastructure. This would remove a potential barrier to adoption, making it easier for customers to evaluate and incorporate the solution.
